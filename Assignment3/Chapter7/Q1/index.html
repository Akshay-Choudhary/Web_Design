			<h2>A community cafe serving home cooked, locally sourced, organic food</h2>
			<p>With stunning views of the ocean, Example Cafe offers the perfect environment to unwind and recharge the batteries.</p>
			<p>Our menu offers a wide range of breakfasts, brunches and lunches, including a range of vegetarian options.</p>
			<p>Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you never need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch the world go by.</p>
			​<h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2>
			<p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
