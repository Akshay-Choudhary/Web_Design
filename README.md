# Web_Design
Created Front End for Web Applications using technologies like HTM5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Jquery,JavaScript, AJAX, AngularJS.

Created an E-Commerce website using all the above mentioned technologies and incorporated funcitonalities like:
1. A person could login using his gmail credentials. I used Gmail API to accomplish this task.
2. Reduced the number of clicks wthat a person has to make by not including unnecessary different pages which improved the User Experience.
3. A person could add any item he/she likes to the cart and can checkout. Used JavaScript to implement this functionality.
4. Used AJAX to display multiple items on the same page by limiting only 20 items per page.
