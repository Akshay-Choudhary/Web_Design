PART 1. Read the following chapters (Beginning HTML)
  Chapter 3: Images and Objects
  Chapter 4: Tables
  Chapter 5: Forms
  Chapter 6: Frames

PART 2. Do all the exercises at the end of these chapters

PART 3. Using tables (I know tables should not be used to create layouts) create http://www.stanford.edu website (try to create a similar layout which doesn't need to be exactly the same as the official website. You could ignore animations, just use an image instead of the animation, and ignore the sub-menus; just use the top-level menu items to make it simpler), and upload to COE. Just provide the link of the site when submitting.

PART 4. Create a personal website that uses frames (I know frames are no longer used). You could use a menu in one frame, and content in the other frame. Upload your site to COE servers, and provide the link of the site when submitting.

PART 5. Convert the Following PDF Form to HTML Form.
HTML Form doesn't need to be 100% identical to the PDF form. Design the form the way you like; you could change the layout as you wish. This would be a web-based form to be submitted via online, so it may be different from the paper form.
For example, in the paper-based form, there is a table to write some information, but in the web-based form user cannot write into the table cells; a form element needs to be used. Upload your site to COE servers, and provide the link of the site when submitting.
